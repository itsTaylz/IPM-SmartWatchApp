# IPM-SmartWatchApp

This is the project was made with one colleagues for our Human Computer Interaction class. The goal was to make an interface of a smartwatch app using web technologies.
This project not only allowed me to learn and experiment with web technologies (HTML, CSS and JavaScript) also introduced us to many concepts of design interfaces, having us also receive and make heuristics analysis from other groups in order to improve our interface. Our application was a friends meeting application to organize events.

At the end we successfully made a good interface, not only in terms of usability but also in aesthetics, we did a final presentation of our project showcasing all the steps to the conception of the interface, from Low Fidelity Prototypes and Storyboards to a full implemented and functional interface, the slides for that presentation can be seen on `presentation.pdf` file.

Our interface not only displays his contents it is also full functional, having screens simulating various actions in a smartwatch and being able to use the whole application, preserving state through web storage.

We obtained a perfect score with this project.
